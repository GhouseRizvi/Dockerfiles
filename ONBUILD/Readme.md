The ONBUILD instruction in a Dockerfile adds a trigger that is executed later when the image is used as a base for building another image. Essentially, ONBUILD specifies commands in the parent image that will automatically run in any child image built FROM that parent. This allows base images to enforce or automate steps like copying files, installing dependencies, or setting configurations in derived images without the child Dockerfile explicitly including those commands.

ONBUILD commands execute right after the FROM instruction in the child image's build process, before any other instructions in the child Dockerfile. If you create a base image with ONBUILD instructions, anyone using that base image inherits those steps automatically, ensuring consistency and reducing duplication. However, ONBUILD triggers run only one level deep and cannot recursively trigger other ONBUILD instructions.
